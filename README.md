📌 Sub-Contractor Inspection Process using QR Codes - Proof of Concept (POC)

This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) developed for Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) to enhance the Sub-Contractor Inspection Process using QR code technology. The system is designed to streamline inspections and enable efficient tracking and documentation.

🔍 Project Overview

This POC utilizes QR codes to manage and track the inspection process of components handled by sub-contractors. The system allows inspectors to scan QR codes attached to components, which then retrieves and displays inspection-related data stored in the database. Additionally, the system generates automated reports (Excel and PDF) to ensure accurate documentation for stakeholders.


✨ Features

🔍 QR Code Scanning: Fast and efficient scanning for component identification.

🗄️ Data Storage & Retrieval: Uses MongoDB for centralized storage of component data, inspection status, and inspection results.

📄 Automated Report Generation: Generates downloadable reports in both Excel and PDF formats.

💻 User Interface: Simple and intuitive frontend for inspectors to scan, view, and manage inspection data.



🛠️ Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

QR Code Library: qr-scanner

Excel Generation: Libraries used for creating downloadable reports in Excel formats
